- Risk: Scalability challenges under high load.
  - Mitigation: Implementing auto-scaling and load balancing mechanisms in our cloud infrastructure.

Scalability and Performance:
The application will be hosted on AWS, utilizing auto-scaling groups and load balancers to manage increased traffic. MongoDB's sharding and replication features will ensure data scalability and reliability.

Testing and Quality Assurance:
We will implement a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes. Our testing strategy includes unit tests for individual components, integration tests for service interactions, and end-to-end tests to validate overall functionality.

Security:
Data will be encrypted both in transit and at rest using industry-standard protocols (TLS/SSL, AES-256). We will conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities. Compliance with GDPR and other relevant data protection regulations will be ensured.
